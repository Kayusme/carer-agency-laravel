                                <p>The nature of care work is that staff are required for all kinds of different shift patterns and quite often through the night. We have night carers and part time care workers to cover these shifts, even at unsociable hours. Whether it’s a few hours, 20 hours or a full night, we can adapt to suit your needs. Many of our care workers have other commitments, such as university, another job or family ties and find that working part time or as a night carer suits their lifestyle.</p>

                                            If you have requirements for a part time or night carer, just get in touch with us and let us know what hours you need covered and the duration. You can contact us by email on info@workers-direct.com or if you prefer to chat over the phone, you can reach us on 020 3086 9080.
