                                <p>The demands of the care industry are such that quite often, you can find yourself with too many patients and not enough staff. We aim to take the stress of these situations out of your hands by being available with candidates who are ready to take on assignments with less than 24 hours’ notice and who are looking for short term assignment. Whether it’s a few hours cover, a few days or weeks, we will do our best to adapt to your circumstances and provide you with staff when you need them, so you can get on with other tasks.
                                    This service also works well for candidates who are looking for some additional work and have the flexibility to meet demands at the last minute. The more flexible our candidates are to working at short notice, the better the chances of getting extra work as it comes in.
                                    With our short term care workers you can expect:
